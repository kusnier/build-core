This file collects things that still need to be implemented / decided / ...

Implementation
===============

* Introduce new artifact type "bootstrap" and replace "zip" with it
  . all "bootstrap" types should indicate they're needed before any XP
    execution takes places
  . extension should remain "zip", though
  Status: DONE

* Improve "install.xml" build file
  . could this use ivy already to fetch dependencies?
  . auto-detection of missing libraries should be improved:
    currently, existance of ivy-${version}.xar indicates whether *all* libs
    are available, and this might not be sufficient in all places; it should
    check each lib independently.

* Implement build "complete" web application zip:
  . add all required files & dependencies
  . create Web container configuration (eg. apache vhost config)
  . define set of replaceable tokens, if any

* Implement build command line application zip:
  . add all required files & dependencies

* Add support for code generation
  . simple frontend for `cgen`
  . added to "generate-sources" target

* Implement syntax checks
  . `php -l` for .php in "validate" phase
  . xmllint for .xml, .xsl


Documentation
==============

* "public" variables
  . which ant settings may a user change

* Targets / phases and their idea
  . may one add new targets? phases?
  . overrideing allowed?


Open decisions
===============

* Custom targets
  . should these be allowed? Eg. this could be a proprietary deployment
    mechanism, or some proprietary custom tasks
    ("make install")
